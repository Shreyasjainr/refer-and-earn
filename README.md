## Refer and Earn

Developed a full-stack Refer & Earn platform to incentivize course referrals. The platform features a responsive frontend built 
with React.js and Tailwind CSS, and a backend using Express.js, Prisma ORM, and MySQL. It captures and stores referral data, 
and sends email notifications via the Google Mail Service API. The frontend was deployed on Netlify and the backend on Render, 
with secure CORS configuration to ensure seamless communication. This project enhanced user engagement and streamlined 
the referral process.
